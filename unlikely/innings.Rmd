A game of Major League Baseball advances through nine consecutive innings---each divided into two halves.  During the "top" of the inning (i.e. the first half), the visiting team can score; during the "bottom," the home team can score.

Our knowledge of the history of the game comes from the meticulously constructed Retrosheet database.  While Major League Baseball began in 1871, in the early days, most events under study forever disappeared from history.  In 1930, sabermatricians began carefully recording each event.  So when we say that a certain occurence has never happened in all Baseball history, we really mean that it was _not recorded_ in the Retrosheet event data set, covering only 1930-2018. Our data ends at the end of the 2018 season, when we started this study.

The Retrosheet database records event data for XXXXXX games (or game data for 218,167 games, going back to 1871) and XXXXXXX half-innings (since 1930), an average of 17.XXX half-innings per game.  One might expect 18 half innings per game, until we consider that the home team clinches a win if it is ahead after the top of the ninth.  In that scenario, the bottom of the ninth is not played (for a total of only 17 half-innings for the game).  On the other hand, if the score is tied at the end of the ninth inning, extra innings are played to break the tie (for a total of more than 18 half-innings for the game). And in exceptional circumstances, the umpire may call the game early (perhaps resulting in fewer than 17 half-innings in the game).
