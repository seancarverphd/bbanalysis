# Notations 

This paper focuses on **transition probabilities**, which describe the ways a half-inning progresses through batting events. A few notes about them:

- There exists eight possible combinations of runners on base (0, 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 23, 123)
- There exists four possible numbers of outs (*blank*, X, XX, XXX)
- A "state" exists through any combination of outs and runners on base. There exist 600 total states. 
- However, only 296 of these states are actually possible. For example, it is impossible to go from two outs to one out, because you cannot "lose" an out in the progression of a half-inning. 

Therefore, we will notate a transition probability as this combination of runners on and outs, followed by a colon (:) to represent that the event is complete. For example, an inning where the first batter gets out, followed by a single, then a double play to end the inning would look as such: 

> 0:0X:1X:XXX
