Of the finite number of half-innings that \emph{have} occurred, which
has (or have) the lowest probability: i.e.~which half-inning(s) is
(are) \emph{the most unlikely half-inning(s) seen in major league
  baseball history}?
How long can we expect to wait to see this (or these) same sequences
first reappear?
As the score gets larger, half-innings become less likely, so there
does not exist a \emph{most unlikely half-inning possible}, nor a
\emph{most unlikely half-inning possible among those that never appeared}.
On the other hand, there must exist one (or more)
most-\emph{likely}-possible half-inning(s), as well as one (or more)
\emph{most-likely-among-the-so-far-unprecedented}.
How long from now can we expect to wait to first see each of these
distinguished half-innings?
Though the \emph{most likely among all possible} half-inning should repeat
frequently enough to allow fans a correct guess, we will nevertheless,
still reveal the answer, and show that we will not have to wait very
long to see it first reappear in the baseball records.  
Presumably, we would have to wait \emph{much} longer to see a particular
so-far-unprecedented half-inning, even the one found to be
\emph{most-likely} among that set.  
Indeed, we have already waited the entire history of the game without
an appearance.
On the other hand, it should take quite a bit less time to first see
\emph{any one among all so far unprecedented half-innings}?  
But how long?
