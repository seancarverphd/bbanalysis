We contribute a repository of R scripts (see GitHub repository below)
that construct a MySQL database of all freely and readily available
data from Major League Baseball.  Our database can find use in
determining unprecedented (meaning never before recorded) occurrences
in the game.  To this end, we create a simple and easily readable
notation for plays in a half-inning (see below).  The Markov chain
model of baseball allows us to compute probabilities for any legal
sequence of plays.  For example ...

The "one-two-three" half-inning (in our notation:
"0:0X:0XX:XXX"---three outs in a row, and no one on base) has the
highest probability of any half-inning (10^-0.5180987).  The "white
whale" half-inning ("0:3:23:XXX"---a triple, a double with runner on
third not advancing, followed by a triple play) has the lowest
probability of any of the 24 possible 3-play half-innings
(10^-9.735438).

The database constructed by our scripts facilitates an exploration of
the commonplace, the rare, and the unprecedented sequences of play in
Major League baseball.
